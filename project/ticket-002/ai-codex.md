# Participant: codex (AI agent)

## Understanding

The domain schema and conformance validator remain authoritative for payload,
effect and authorization semantics. Lifecycle DSL adds a common structural
projection and a portable fail-closed gate; it does not replace those rules.

## Execution plan

1. Pin the reviewed standalone Lifecycle DSL validator by source revision and
   byte digest.
2. Add the exact governed ticket state graph as a local profile.
3. Extend domain conformance with digest, DSL and graph-equality checks.
4. Run existing adversarial, static, networkless-container and governance
   validation before publication.

## Actual changes

- Initialized the bounded ticket and recorded SESSION_EXECUTION_AUTHORIZATION
  from the request to execute this work.

## Blockers

- None inside the recorded intent; proceed without a second confirmation.
- New authority remains required for destructive action, secret access, new
  external coordination, material objective expansion and trusted merge.
