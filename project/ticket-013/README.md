# Ticket 013: Adopt wellmanifest/new-project 0.20.32 governance standard

- **ID**: ticket-013
- **Owner**: unresolved:human
- **Status**: IN_PROGRESS
- **Workflow state**: EDIT
- **Created**: 2026-09-17

## Goal and scope

Adopt the wellmanifest/new-project standard update from pinned 0.19.19
(revision `43999c793a86084b4c3198fe07be350105db59ec`) to available 0.20.32 (revision `b6ba9c21a65a6a5648ecf904b64c3b75295e136f`) inside the
canonical worktree for this ticket, base `200af096`.

The adoption is performed by the managed adoption tool
(`goal governance adopt --latest --upgrade`) and replaces reviewed
standard-managed drift only. Unknown local work in the primary checkout is left
untouched.

Where the repository carried a local `ticket` override in
`.governance/manifest.json`, it is replaced by `.governance/manifest.base.json`:
0.20.32 validates that block literally against the managed base, so the adopted
projection fails `GOV-MANIFEST-001` until the override is dropped.

## Acceptance criteria

- [x] AC-01: Scope is approved by a human owner (session instruction to execute
      the wellmanifest-standard rollout across the fleet backlog; STARTER-663 is
      this repository's entry).
- [x] AC-02: `goal governance adopt --latest --check` reports no remaining
      standard-managed drift and `./project/governance-check.sh` passes on the
      ticket branch.
